# Stage 1/6: Addition
Matrices have a wide range of applications in programming: they're used for digital image processing, graph representation and algorithms on a graph, graphic effects, applied math, statistics, and much more.

Since matrices are tables of numbers, they are usually presented in code as 2D-lists. In this project, you will learn how to read and output matrices, do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix. At first, you will work with matrices with integer elements, and later the elements will be floating-point numbers.

# Description
Let’s start with matrix addition.

For two matrices to be added, they must have an equal number of rows and columns. The sum of matrices $A$ and $B$ will be a matrix with the same number of rows and columns as $A$ or $B$. The sum of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A+B$ or $B+A$, is computed by adding the corresponding elements of $A$ and $B$: $`(A+B)_{n,m}=A_{n,m}+B_{n,m}`$. Notice that $n$ in the index $_{n,m}$ represents the row and $m$ represents the column.

Here is a simple example with numbers:
```math
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
6 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
5 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
8 & 8 & 2 & 9 \end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
7 & 7 & 0 & 1 \\
9 & 9 & 9 & 2 \\
5 & 4 & 3 & 12 \\
0 & 6 & 5 & 6 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2+7 & 4+7 & 5+0 & 6+1 \\
6+9 & 6+9 & 7+9 & 8+2 \\
5+5 & 0+4 & 0+3 & 1+12 \\
8+0 & 8+6 & 2+5 & 9+6 \end{pmatrix}
```


## Objectives
In this stage, you should write a program that:

- Reads matrix $A$ from the input.
- Reads matrix $B$ from the input.
- Outputs their sum if it is possible to add them. Otherwise, it should output the `ERROR` message.

Each matrix in the input is given in the following way: the first line contains the number of rows $n$ and the number of columns $m$. Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers representing one row of the matrix.

Output the result in the same way but don't print the dimensions of the matrix.

## Examples
<b>Example 1:</b>

Input:
```
4 5
1 2 3 4 5
3 2 3 2 1
8 0 9 9 1
1 3 4 5 6
4 5
1 1 4 4 5
4 4 5 7 8
1 2 3 9 8
1 0 0 0 1
```

Output:
```
2 3 7 8 10
7 6 8 9 9
9 2 12 18 9
2 3 4 5 7
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

Input:
```
2 3
1 4 5
4 5 5
4 5
0 1 0 4 5
1 7 8 9 4
1 2 3 5 6
1 3 4 3 8
```

Output:
```
ERROR
